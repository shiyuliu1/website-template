In this data science project, an entire data science pipeline was built from scratch: Obtaining raw data from website, storing data inside database (MongoDB), retrieving and processing data from database and visualizing data based on users' queries. Specifically, the data we are using is dynamic and it is constantly acquired from the web. We then renew such data into the MongoDB database, making the updated data ready to be renewed. Once a new query is input throguh the dash user interface.

Please take a look at our final screen cast [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Va7-h8roagSQ0-7eA0EM4iLNC2IY-Zpi/view) demonstrating the usage of user interface and how this pipeline was designed. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/data1050projectfall2019/data1050project). You can fork it to your own git repository and run it on gitpod[https://www.gitpod.io/].
