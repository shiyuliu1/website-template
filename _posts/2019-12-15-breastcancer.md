Forecasting breast cancer can significantly increase the survival rate of patients, and classifying the
sample tumor cells as malignant or benign is one of the best and most direct ways to make accurate
predictions. Breast Cancer Wisconsin from UCI Machine Learning Repository was chosen as the dataset
to implement machine models and predict diagnosis result on practical cases. The target variable in this
dataset is the final diagnosis whether the tumor is malignant or benign. There are 30 real-valued
columns as independent variables with three properties, mean, standard error and worst cases, for
10 cytological features.

A wide range of machine learning algorithms were applied to this dataset.
